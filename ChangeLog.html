        Early Versions (26/7/2020 -> TbA)
      </h1>
      <h4>The Start (26/7/2020)</h4>
      Created and started the project.
      <h2>
        <a href="https://v0-1multiplyingidlegame.glitch.me">v0.1</a> ~ The First
        Version (29/7/2020)
      </h2>
      The first officially released version of the game.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Implemented Multipliers.</b></li>
        <li>
          Started work on 3 tabs, but only the 1<sup>st</sup> tab has content
          for now. They are:
          <ul>
            <li>Multipliers</li>
            <li>Settings</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Simple CSS.</li>
        <li>Added Multiplier Prestiges.</li>
        <li>
          Production is based on time since last frame to stabilise progress and
          to allow for off-tab progression.<br />No Oflline Progression yet
          though.
        </li>
        <li>
          Added and started working on the Change Log on this game, which is
          what you are on currently.

        <li>And Useless Functions!</li>

      <b>Known Bugs:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The "Buy Multiplier" Bug:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The game is not playable on most PCs, as the "Buy Multiplier"
              buttons do not work there.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, on Mobile, the bug is still present, but not as major. Only
              sometimes do "Buy Multiplier" buttons work, which can still be
              annoying.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Fun Facts:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>I coded this update on mobile, explaining the PC bugs ;-;</li>
      </ul>
      <h3><a href="/">v0.2</a> ~ A Crucial Update (1/8/2020)</h3>
      An important update that greatly increases playability, but isn't too
      major content-wise.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Added an Auto-saving feature.</b> This also allows for more
          progressing means like offline-like progression.
        </li>
        <li>
          Balanced the game.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Decreased the Multiplier Prestige costs from<br />
              <i>[250, 1000, 5e4, 1e7, 1e10, 1e15, 1e20, 1e26, 1e32]</i>
              to<br />
              <i>[250, 1000, 5e4, 7.5e6, 1e10, 1.25e14, 1e19, 2e24, 1e30]</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also nerfed the effect from Mutliplier Prestiges to Number growth,
              from
              <b>((<var>x</var> + 1)<sup>2</sup> + <var>x</var> + 1) / 2</b> to
              simply <b><var>x</var>+1</b>, where <b><var>x</var></b> represents
              how many Multiplier Prestiges you have performed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimised the game's code a bit by decreasing lines of code and
          processes (such as
          <code>for</code> loops) while maintaining performance.
        </li>
        <li>Some CSS tweaks to make things look a lil' better.</li>
        <li>Tweaked + sorted out some JS code and changed the <code>game.multipliers</code> format from <code>{amount:[number,number],boost:[number,number]}</code> to <code>[{amount:number,boost:number},{amount:number,boost:number}]</code>, and changed the code that gets the variable accordingly.</li>
        <li>Removed the effect from some browsers on mobile where when you double click, the screen will zoom in, and the click delay. This gets annoying, so I decided to remove that feature.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Also disabled selecting. This may be a controversial change.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Added more styling to the Change Log.</li>
        <li>
          <b>Also added PC support!</b> I did this by performing as listed in
          the <b>Bug Fixes</b> section of this Update.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Bug Fixes:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Fixed the "Buy Multiplier" Bug (both on Mobile and PC) by:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Changing the way the Multipliers section of the 1<sup>st</sup>
              tab, or "tab1" in the HTML, updates.
              <br />
              In this way, no longer would it update every frame, rather only
              when the player performs a certain action such as buying a
              Multiplier.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also separating the code that updates the Multiplier values from
              initially, in order to make this possible.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <b>Known Bugs:</b>
